        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 0.7s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            A very very Happy Birthday to you! On this special day, I just want to take a moment to tell you how much you truly mean. Birthdays are always special because they remind us how far someone has come, how much they’ve grown, and how many beautiful moments still lie ahead. And today, it’s all about you.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 0.9s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            Honestly, I wish you were here so I could physically gift you something with my own hands, wrap it nicely, and see that smile on your face. But since you are in Nagpur and I am in Pune, distance is something we can’t avoid. Still, even if I can’t be there with you, I want my wishes and prayers to reach you and stay with you always.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 1.1s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            Tejal, I always wish the very best for you, not just today, but every single day. I genuinely pray for your academics, your studies, and your career because I know you have the potential to achieve big things. You’re hardworking, you’re capable, and I know that if you believe in yourself, nothing in this world can stop you from achieving your dreams.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 1.3s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            More than anything, I wish you good health because that’s the most precious gift of all. May you always stay happy, healthy, and full of energy. May your life be filled with endless joy, laughter, and positivity. May you achieve all the goals you set for yourself and still find time to live freely, to enjoy small moments, and to cherish the people around you.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 1.5s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            I also want you to take good care of yourself, Tejal. Sometimes in between studies, responsibilities, and daily routines, we forget about ourselves. So always remember to put yourself first, to rest when you’re tired, to laugh when life gets heavy, and to never let stress dull your brightness. You are such a special person, and you deserve all the peace and happiness.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 1.7s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            On this birthday, I pray for your growth, your success, and your peace of mind. I pray that life only gives you reasons to smile, that you always have people who truly value you, and that your journey is filled with beautiful experiences. And yes, I do pray for you daily because I genuinely want to see you shine.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 1.9s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            Tejal, you are one of those people who make life feel lighter and better just by being yourself. That’s rare, and it’s something I admire. Always stay the way you are kind, funny, smart, and full of masti. Don’t ever let the world change your beautiful nature.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 2.1s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            And also, whenever you feel low or upset, just remember that “thumak–thumak” video of mine. I’m pretty sure it will work as your emergency smile button because even I can’t stop laughing at it sometimes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 2.3s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            So, once again, a very Happy Birthday to you, Tejal. May this year bring you closer to your dreams, may your heart always stay kind, and may you look back on this day with only good memories. Enjoy every bit of your birthday because it’s your day, and you deserve to feel special.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed animate-fadeInSlideUp" style="animation-delay: 2.5s; animation-duration: 1s;">
            And yes, don’t forget to save me a piece of cake. If not, then at least the story of how you finished it all by yourself I’ll be waiting for that too.
        </p>
